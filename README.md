## Simple Travis-like CI/CD backend for Ochopod

### Overview

This repo is a small set of [**Ochopod**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochopod) images forming together a simple,
no-nonsense CI/CD backend which can be easily integrated with Git. The CI part uses Redis as a small queue propagating
HTTP POST requests from Git hooks into a pool of build slaves. The slaves piggy-back on their host Docker daemon to
build or push images while keeping repositories and their artifacts cached. Builds happen upon a git push and can be
customized using a simple [**Travis**](https://travis-ci.org) like description file.

This backend is scalable, 100% [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) based and can be easily specialized given your
workflow !

The CD part meshes with the [**Ochothon**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochothon) proxy to remotely execute
complex deployment procedures on behalf of external tools like Jenkins.

### Documentation

Our [**Sphinx**](http://sphinx-doc.org/) documentation can be found under docs/. Just go in there and build for your
favorite target, for instance:

```
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

The docs will be written to _docs/_build/html_. This is all Sphinx based and you have many options and knobs to
tweak.
